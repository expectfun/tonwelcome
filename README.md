This is an experimental repo to test out some prototype-stage things (mostly vibecoded Telegram Mini Apps) just to see what works in that format. All the "real work" happens outside of this repo.

So it's probably a good idea not to look into it at all, or your risk shattering your faith in humanity.

But if you insist, start with the [expectfun.github.io/tonwelcome](https://expectfun.github.io/tonwelcome) ironic "Hello World" website urging to send some Toncoins.
